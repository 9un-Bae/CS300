This course is an Introduction to Network Systems and Management , focusing on the Foundational aspects of networking.  This includes all aspects of Networking from the Foundational elements (OSI Model, IP addressing, Network Protocols), Security (Cybersecurity), and Design (SOHO, Enterprise, Cloud, Wireless). I will also explain how networking correlates and integrates with computer sciences aspects to show how integral and dependent they are with each other. Assignments will be  combination of problem solving and research on various networking topics. The last part of the course will entail setting up parts of an enterprise network similar to what you would see in real-world scenarios.
